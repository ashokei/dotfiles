	<string>-- This is v0.4 of the custom script for AlfredApp for iTerm 2.1.1
-- Modified by @jedahan to always open a new terminal
-- Please see https://github.com/stuartcryan/custom-iterm-applescripts-for-alfred/
-- for the latest changes.

-- Please note, if you store the iTerm binary in any other location than the Applications Folder
-- please ensure you update the two locations below (in the format of : rather than / for folder dividers)
-- this gets around issues with AppleScript not handling things well if you have two iTerm binaries on your system... which can happen :D
